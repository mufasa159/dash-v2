# Dash V2

Web-based dashboard containing a variety of visualizations and
interactive elements for personal data tracking, analysis and
monitoring.

This is an improved version of one of my archived projects from
2021 when I was relatively new to NextJS. The original repositories
can be found at the links below:

## Project Structure

Dash V2 is built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) with
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the main database. 

This dashboard is meant to run locally in a private server. So,
there's no authentication mechanism in place. But maybe in the
future?
